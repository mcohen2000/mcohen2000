### Hi there, my name is Michael Cohen. ðŸ‘‹

I am a front-end focused JavaScript developer with a passion for delivering exceptional user experiences. I have a strong attention to detail and a talent for solving problems through creative and collaborative means. With a background in both tech support and graphic design, I bring a unique skill set to the table, making me an asset to any development team. I am driven by the challenge of transforming wireframes into pixel-perfect interfaces and always aim to write clean, maintainable code. I am eager to continue my growth as a developer and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of technology and design.
